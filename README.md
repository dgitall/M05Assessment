# M05Assessment

Note: Access to the interactive PowerBI dashboard can be provided on request (dgerber@dev-10.com) 
## Introduction
This project encompasses everything covered from the following topics:

1. Data Literacy
2. Relational Data
3. Excel
4. Power BI
5. Data Visualizations
## Scenario
We are interested in learning more about the quality of life in the US. The primary dataset to start with will be the Behavioral Risk Factor Data: Health-Related Quality of Life as presented by the CDC.

1. What are the factors that impact the quality of life?
2. Could the factors of quality of life vary from area to area?
You are presented with a couple of data sets to start. You may have your own hypotheses on what impacts the quality of life. You may need to grab other data to help support your hypotheses.

## Starting Data Sets
* Behavioral Risk Factor Data: Health-Related Quality of Life (data.world)
* US Population by Zip Code (Kaggle)
## High-Level Requirements
1. Understand the datasets involved in solving the problem.
2. Come up with a project management plan to show how you want to attack this. This needs to be instructor-approved before work commences. Ex. Jira, Trello, spreadsheet, etc.
3. Create a document that explains all ETL that was involved with the project. Use Power Query for the ETL. This report should include numbered steps when the order matters. Your ETL should be repeatable by another person.
  * See the ETL Report Guide for more guidance on the ETL report.
4. Create napkin drawings of visualizations for your final report.
5. Get feedback on the visualizations napkin drawings from at least 2 classmates. Document their feedback.
6. Incorporate feedback into the final visualizations.
7. Create a dashboard in Power BI based on your napkin drawing.
  * A tile that introduces the datasets, including links to the data
  * At least 1 visualization per dataset, with all axes and charts, labeled clearly
  * At least 1 report that uses a slicer for filtering
8. Create a project report that includes the following:
  * Identify the questions being answered, and includes answering the starting questions in the scenario.
  * Introduce the datasets and cite them accordingly.
  * Describe what was discovered in the research.
  * Support your descriptions with visualizations.
    * Half of the visualizations should be created in Excel.
    * Half of the visualizations should be created in Power BI.
  * Explain what your visualizations represent and why they are relevant to the proposed questions.
  * Include a correlation matrix or some other table that shows the Analysis Toolpak from Excel.
  * Address any decisions that can be made from this data.
## Deliverables
* Project Management Plan
* ETL documentation
* Napkin drawings of visualizations
* Document of napkin drawing of visualizations feedback
* Power BI dashboard - as a shareable link or a screenshot
* Project Report
Filename must include your name and clearly calls out what is in the contents of it.
